A. Describe project experience including each phase of the SDLC and the project artifacts (design documents, requirements trace, test reports...)

B. code and architecture walk-through

C. product demonstration (no final product yet)

D. lessons learned:

what did you do right?

  -understanding of software development lifecycle
  
  
what did you do wrong?

  -not knowing proper requirements to achieve final product
  
  -planning and designing


where were you lucky?

  -I was able to find similar products online to get inspired.
  
  
what would you change / what do you know now that you wish you knew "then"?

  -I would have chosen a much simpler project idea. I now know that this is a very difficult goal to achieve. This requires lots of knowledge for html, javascript and database management. This project requires far more complex programming knowledge I do not currently possess. I like finishing what I started so I will continually work on this project.
